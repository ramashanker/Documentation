Varna

Varn System::

    Vedas:
    Evidence:
    Stephanie Jamison and Joel Brereton, a professor of Sanskrit and Religious studies
    Ram Sharan Sharma states that "the Rig Vedic society was neither organized on the basis of social division
    of labour nor on that of differences in wealth.
    Rigvedic Purusha Sukta पुरुषसूक्तम् (RV 10.90.11–12)
    • Brahmins: priests, scholars and teachers.
    • Kshatriyas: rulers, warriors and administrators.
    • Vaishyas: agriculturalists and traders.
    • Shudras: laborers and service providers.

    Many 19th and early 20th century scholars questioned as to when parts or all of Purusha Sukta were composed,
    and whether some of these verses were present in the ancient version of Rigveda.
    They suggest it was interpolated in post-Vedic era[17] and is a relatively modern origin of Purusha Sukta.

    यत् पुरुषं व्यदधुः कतिधा व्यकल्पयन्।
    मुखं किम् अस्य कौ बाहू का ऊरू पादा उच्येते॥११॥
    ब्राह्मणो ऽस्य मुखम् आसीद् बाहू राजन्यः कृतः।
    ऊरू तद् अस्य यद् वैश्यः पद्भ्यां शूद्रो अजायत॥१२॥

    11 When they divided Puruṣa how many portions did they make?
    What do they call his mouth, his arms? What do they call his thighs and feet?
    12 The Brahmin was his mouth, of both his arms was the R ājanya made.
    His thighs became the Vaiśya, from his feet the Śūdra was produced.

The Dharmasastras::

    Patrick Olivelle , a professor of Sanskrit and Indian Religions
    The Varna system in Dharma-shastras divides society into four varnas (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishya and
    Shudras)
    Those who fall out of this system because of their grievous sins are ostracised as outcastes
    (untouchables) and considered outside the varna system
    The only mention of impurity in the Shastra texts from the 1st millennium is about people who commit
    grievous sins and thereby fall out of their varna.
    Dharma-sastra texts concerns "individuals irrespective of their varna affiliation" and all four varnas
    could attain purity or impurity by the content of their character, ethical intent, actions, innocence or
    ignorance, stipulations, and ritualistic behaviours
    Once the person born he is free from previous inheritance varn. Based on his karma he will fall to the
    specific varna.
