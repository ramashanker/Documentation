Gold Mohur, AH1202::

    Description British East India Company, the Bengal Presidency, Gold Mohur dated AH1202 Regnal Year ‘frozen’ 19,
    Crescent Mintmark Variety, minted at Calcutta in the name of ‘Murshidabad’ circa 1831-1835 AD,
    in honour of Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II. Obverse: Arabic script with a translation:
    “Defender of the religion of Muhammad, Shah ‘Alam Emperor, Shadow of the divine favour,
    put his stamp on the seven climes, 1202”. Reverse: As obverse, “Struck at Murshidabad in the 19th year of his
    reign of tranquil prosperity”. Edge: Oblique left grain milling. Stv-9.3.
    Certified and Graded by NGC as a Mint State 62 (4861249-005). A choice example that is quite clearly
    mint state – the surfaces are lovely. The very minor surface marks on the right aspect of the reverse pale before
    the overall detail and eye appeal this coin exhibits.
    The Bengal Presidency Gold Mohur was one of the foreign denominations chosen during the Australian
    Proclamation of 1800 by Philip Gidley King, the Governor of New South Wales. It had a high face value of
    one pound, 17 shillings and sixpence in order to disincentivize the removal of currency outside of the Australian
    colonies. This coin, although a type struck for India by the East India Company in the Bengal Presidency,
    is a remarkable piece of Australia’s early history as a growing colony of Great Britain.

    Price: $2,750.00
